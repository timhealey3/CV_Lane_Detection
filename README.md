## Computer Vision Autonomous Car

### How to run
Python libraries tensorflow, numpy, and matplotlib.

### Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is twofold. One I am very interested in autonomous vehicles, and I want to get experience working with it. Secondly, I have theoritical knowledge of preceptrons and CNNs (from lectures, books, and blogs) and this project allows me to implement these algorithms in a real world setting.
