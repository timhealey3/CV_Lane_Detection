I will write my notes on my learning about computer vision for self driving cars here

Perception

Road Segmentation - Convulated Neural Network

- given input = find road present in image
- obvisouly dont want to hard code b/c that would only work on one image
- fully convuly nerual netowrk
  - fully end to end
  - no pre processing or post processing on image
- road image -> fcn model -> binary image (1 for road, 0 for not road)
- upsampling : decide on what values to be on NxN squares
  - bed of nails : assign all original image block value to upsample block values 
    - simple and make a lot of zeroes
  - nearest neighbor
  - interpolation
    - assigning values of blocks through averages
    - take average between the nearest neighbors of blocks
  - transposed convulations
    - assign values based on filter
      - random weight values
    - backpropagation
